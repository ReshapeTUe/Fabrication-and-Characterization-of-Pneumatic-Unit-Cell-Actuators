# Fabrication-and-Characterization-of-Pneumatic-Unit-Cell-Actuators
Pneumatic Unit Cells (PUC) are soft, hollow cylinder actuators fabricated using silicone. This repository contains the data presented in the MPDI Actuator journal paper.

# Data
The xlsx file consists of 
1. Thickness measurement data
2. Free deflection - static pressure condition
3. Blocking force - static pressure condition
4. Free deflection - Frequency condition
